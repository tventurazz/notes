:pushpin: **The Hidden Frequency of Control: How Microwaves Can Alter Your Brain’s Reality**

*The possibility of manipulating the human brain remotely, using electromagnetic radiation, has long been a subject of speculation and controversy. What many people don't realize is that scientific research into this area has been ongoing for decades, with some discoveries only recently coming to light. One of the pioneers in this field, Allan H. Frey, made groundbreaking observations as early as 1962, suggesting that pulsed microwaves could have profound effects on the human nervous system. His work would not only shape the future of bioelectromagnetic research but also pave the way for the development of technologies that may have far-reaching implications for society.*

:pushpin: **Moscow Signal**

*The **Moscow Signal** was a reported microwave transmission, directed at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow from 1953 to 1976, resulting in an international incident. There were no significant health effects on embassy staff, although this conclusion has been disputed.*

:pushpin: **Bioeffects of Selected Nonlethal Weapons (Privately reported in 1998 by the US Department of the Army)**

*Application of the microwave hearing technology could facilitate a private message transmission. It may be useful to provide a disruptive condition to a person not aware of the technology. Not only might it be disruptive to the sense of hearing, it could be psychologically devastating if one suddenly heard "voices within one's head. "*

:pushpin: **Neuroenhancement in Military Personnel: Conceptual and Methodological Promises and Challenges**

*Six neuromodulation techniques are considered, including
Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), transcranial Focused Ultrasound Stimulation (tFUS), transcranial
Electrical Stimulation (tES), transcutaneous Peripheral Nerve Stimulation (tPNS), PhotoBioModulation
(PBM), and Cranial Electrotherapy Stimulation (CES). Three neurofeedback techniques are considered,
including the use of ElectroEncephaloGraphy (EEG), functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), and
functional Near-InfraRed Spectroscopy (fNIRS) for monitoring brain states, with feedback loops enabled
through machine learning and artificial intelligence. Representatives from each participating nation
summarize basic and applied research leveraging one or more of these neuromodulation and neurofeedback
technologies for the purposes of enhancing Warfighter cognitive performance.*

:pushpin: **THE NATO SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY ORGANIZATION “EMPOWERING THE ALLIANCE’S TECHNOLOGICAL EDGE”**

*"The Cognitive Domain is a new space of competition, beyond the land, maritime, air, cybernetic and space domains. Warfare in the cognitive domain mobilizes a different and wide range of strategies, tools, and techniques. It seeks to optimize human cognitive abilities to achieve advantage over a situation or adversary."* (OTAN-STO)
